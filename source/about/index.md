What fortunate happenstance that we happen to meet!

I'm Tiago, here's a few things about me and this website:
- I'm ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹
- I've been professionally writing software since 2015, working on comercial games since 2022
- Currently I'm working as a Senior Gameplay Engineer at [Maverick Games](https://maverick-games.com/) working on a slightly announced game, see: [Amazon Games signs publishing deal with Maverick Games for new narrative-led open-world driving game](https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/maverick-games-publishing-agreement)
- My first game was Sonic Dream Team (shoutout to HARDlight and Sega)
- This website is made with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) using the [Cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) theme if you want to pinch it for yourself :)
