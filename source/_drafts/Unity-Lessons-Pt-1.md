# What's this about?

I worked on [Sonic Dream Team](https://sonicdreamteam.com/) for several years, and as I looked back on its development, I think there were lessons learned that can prove to be useful to someone who, is going to be scouring the internet for solutions to the same problems we faced when developing a fully commercial game with Unity.

My goal here is to showcase problems and solutions that I was able to gather, that might actively and directly help someone that is going through the same problems we did. And just in case someone from Unity Technologies happens to read this at some point, I will try to express why things are difficult from us on the other side, and maybe offer some suggestions on how to improve things, with that said let's get started!

# Baselines

Although I have done by best to investigate if these issues are present in Unity 6, the most time spent testing and evaluating things here was done with Unity's LTS 2021, so always keep that in mind if you are experiencing different results.
